        <p> My name is Saif Aziz. I was born in Brooklyn, New York and lived there for the first eight years of my life. Then I moved to <br> Queens, New York where I spent most of my childhood. In late 2013, my parents decided to open up a fast food buisness in Rhode Island. I have lived in Cranston, Rhode Island ever since. I love <br> listening to rap music. My top five favorite artists would have to be JCole, Kid Cudi, Kanye West, Logic, and Biggie Smalls. I grew up on rap music and it a very important part of my life. I am a <br> sophmore at the University of Rhode Island and I am a finance major and a computer science minor. I took computer science seriously in my four years of high school, and felt that I had to <br> pursue in my life. Hopefully, I can get something out of attending this college and I am on the right path to be successful and a well-paying job. Thank you so much for looking through my <br> portfolio and I am looking foward to finishing this course with a an amazing grade.</p>
